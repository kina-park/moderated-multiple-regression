### Abstract 

**1. Objective**
  * The purpose of this study is to explore factors which predict Korean public’s attitude toward asylum seekers, using integrated threat theory and contact theory as theoretical frameworks. 

**2. Methods**  
  * Data were collected in February 2021 via online survey with 800 adults in Korea.

**3. Results** 
  * The findings showed that integrated threat theory and contact theory are useful frameworks in explaining Koreans' attitude towards asylum seekers. 
  * As the results of multiple regression analyses, realistic, symbolic, and safety and cohesion threats were shown to predict attitudes toward refugees. Most of the participants in this study were found to contact with refugees (asylum seekers) through mass media or the Internet and SNS. Analyzing by contact types also confirmed the importance of contact quality in predicting attitudes toward refugees. 
  * In addition, the analysis of moderating effect showed the significant moderating effect of contact quality on the relationship between the frequency of mass media contact and positive behavioral intention toward asylum seekers.

  * In other words, increase in the frequency of contact through mass media is negatively associated with positive behavioral intention toward asylum seekers, but as the positive evaluation of contact through mass media increases, positive behavioral intention toward asylum seekers also increases. 

**4. Conclusion & Implications** 
  * Accordingly, this study suggested considering ways to facilitate the formation of public’s positive attitude toward refugees by promoting understanding refugees and positive contact experiences with them through mass media and the Internet.
